# ATTINY85 OSX PY PAYLOADS

##Easily run any python payload on OSX using ATTINY85 rubber ducky using curl

When I initially got an ATTINY85 from Digispark, I wanted to use it as a rubber ducky. I intended to have it run [EvilOSX](https://github.com/Marten4n6/EvilOSX) when plugged in, however, due to limitations on the ATTINY85, I was unable to flash the duckyscript generated by EvilOSX. I instead wrote a simple script to easily fetch and run python payloads using curl, deleting it afterwards.

##To use

Simply upload your python script to pastebin or your preferred service, and replace the link in the code. Flash it to your ATTINY85, and you're done!
